To compile, open a terminal and type:
	g++ readCSV4.cpp -o read
	read apps.csv

This code was built using Windows.
It was based on a code for reading CSV files from http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/17771/
and adapted by Ludymila Lobo [llag@icomp.ufam.edu.br] 
to read data extracted from Alan Bezerra, both from Federal University of Amazonas,
for Ludymila's Final Project in Computer Science course, which was oriented by Arilo Dias.
